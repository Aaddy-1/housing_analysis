My first learning experience of machine learning using decision trees and random forest models.

Here is what I learned from this very small project:
1) I learned how to split data into training and testing sets and how to manipulate data using pandas.
2) I learned how to use a decision tree model as well as a random forest model to fit my training data.
3) I learned how to test my model for accuracy using the mean absolute error metric.
4) I learned how to fine tune a decision tree model in order to correct for overfitting.
 
I hope I can build on what I learned here in future projects.
